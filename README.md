# Movie-Theatre-Seat-Reservation
A command-line program demonstrating the use of Multithreading. The application allows a user to input the number of seats in a single theatre and the number of people trying to book these seats at the same time. The idea is to prevent other users from taking a seat once a reservation on one has been made.
